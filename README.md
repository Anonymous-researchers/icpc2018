# icpc2018 paper submittion dataset

## This is the demonstration dataset of our ICPC submitted paper. We provide the details of two migration rules. The link to the complete dataset will be updated in the paper upon its publication

## This is the set of functions mappings detected by the three algorithms under comparison. We show the result of each algorithm along with its instances in the source code (commits) if the mapping exists in the projects under study. We also provide the prevision and recall for the three algorithms.
